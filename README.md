# Building A Web-Application with React 
In this Repo I created a web application with React and the NASA API. Further, I created my first repo in GitHub to gain some experience with this amazing tool. 
I want to learn everything about the possibilities with Git and little software projects in order to practice for future excercices. 
Stay tuned and enjoy!
